# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

I developed this project to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The main goal was to group similar types of customers together and visualize the clusters through an interactive Streamlit web app.

## 🔧 Tech Stack Used

- Python
- Streamlit (for interactive web app)
- pandas and numpy (for data handling)
- scikit-learn (for K-Means clustering)
- matplotlib and seaborn (for visualization)

## 📂 Project Files

- `app.py` – My Streamlit app where the clustering is performed and visualized.
- `Mall_Customers.csv` – The dataset I used for clustering.
- `requirements.txt` – Contains the Python libraries needed to run this project.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

If you want to run this project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
